# BankLoanReport
**Overview**

The Bank Loan Report Project combines SQL for data manipulation and Power bi for visualization to create a comprehensive report on bank loan data. This report aims to provide stakeholders with actionable insights into loan applications, approvals, and related metrics.

**Data Source**

The loan data for this project is sourced from Internet

**Tools**

SQL: The project leverages SQL queries to retrieve, process, and analyze data database.
Power Bi: Dynamic and interactive visualizations are crafted in Power Bi to present key findings effectively.

**Dashboard 1**

The Summary Dashboard captures key loan-related metrics and their changes over time.
It includes the following KPIs:

Total Loan Applications (Month to Date[MTD] and Previous Month to Date[PMTD])

Total Funded Amount (Month to Date[MTD] and Previous Month to Date[PMTD])

Total Amount Received (Month to Date[MTD] and Previous Month to Date[PMTD])

Average Interest Rate (Month to Date[MTD] and Previous Month to Date[PMTD])

Avg Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI) (Month to Date[MTD] and Previous Month to Date[PMTD])



it distinguishes between 'Good Loans' and 'Bad Loans,' with specific indicators for each category

**Dashboard-2**

The Overview Dashboard visually represents various loan-related metrics through different chart types:

Monthly Trends by Issue Date

Regional Analysis by State

Loan Term Analysis

Employment Length Analysis

Loan Purpose Breakdown

Home Ownership Analysis

These visualizations aid in identifying trends, seasonal patterns, and the distribution of loans across various categories.

**Dashboard-3**

The Details Dashboard offers a detailed view of the loan data, providing a comprehensive and user-friendly interface for accessing vital loan metrics, borrower profiles, and performance data.


**Data Validation**

To ensure the accuracy and integrity of the data reflected in the dashboards, a thorough data validation process was undertaken. After the dataset was loaded into Power Bi Desktop and from SQL Server database.
SQL Query Verification: Direct queries were executed against the SQL Server database to retrieve raw data.
KPI Logic Validation: The calculations and logic underlying the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were thoroughly reviewed. SQL scripts were employed to independently replicate the KPI calculations, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the computations performed in Power Bi

**Conclusion**

By incorporating robust data validation techniques, the Bank Loan Dashboard project establishes itself as a reliable and authoritative source for monitoring the bankâ€™s loan activities. The project not only presents critical data through intuitive visualizations but also guarantees the precision of the information displayed, enabling the bank to make informed and assured strategic decisions with confidence.
